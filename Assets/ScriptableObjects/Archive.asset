    title: Alexander
    description: "Captain of the 7th Sub-Regiment, Rank B-1 Angel, Alexander, Reporting
      in.\r\n\nEgo is the death of my comrades; although I can't fault them, the
      allure of victory blinds their judgment. I was not originally the captain of
      this sub-Regement, but the previous captain led everyone into a blood bath.
      The main regiment believes I hid, coward from my order to fight, if only they
      knew I stood and fought, dreaming my comrades could take another breath.\r\n\nBut
      I am now alone in my fight; higher-ups order me to return, that only an Archangel
      can go further alone. How can I return with the only thing on my hands being
      the blood of my friends\u2026\r\n"

    title: The HALO Wars
    description: 'The HALO wars began around 450 years ago, after a prophet told
      of a being capable of wielding both Angelic and Demonic power, something not
      seen since the 3 Angels of times pass.


      The underworld had been building
      an amulet to suppress such energy, something our realm had not the capability
      to forge. If our realm held rule of such an amulet, we could ensure the safety
      and suppression of such a being, if the prophesy is to arrive.


      It would
      be wrong to act as though we are not the ones who started this. However, the
      universe will be benefited by us controlling the amulet... this is for the
      greater good

    title: The Amulet
    description: "A device, equipped around the waist, with the power to suppress
      both angelic and demonic power. And what will be the last hope for the final
      realm to wield it as the prophesy is foretold\u2026\r\n\nDemonic and Angelic
      powers hold no moral stance. You can be filled with angelic power, yet angels
      have gone rogue and joined the underworld in their fight."
