    title: Alexander
    description: "Captain of the 7th Sub-Regiment, Rank B-1 Angel, Alexander, Reporting
      in.\r\n\nEgo is the death of my comrades; although I can't fault them, the
      allure of victory blinds their judgment. I was not originally the captain of
      this sub-Regement, but the previous captain led everyone into a blood bath.
      The main regiment believes I hid, coward from my order to fight, if only they
      knew I stood and fought, dreaming my comrades could take another breath.\r\n\nBut
      I am now alone in my fight; higher-ups order me to return, that only an Archangel
      can go further alone. How can I return with the only thing on my hands being
      the blood of my friends\u2026\r\n"

    title: The HALO Wars
    description: 'The HALO wars began around 450 years ago, after a prophet told
      of a being capable of wielding both Angelic and Demonic power, something not
      seen since the 3 Angels of times pass.


      The underworld had been building
      an amulet to suppress such energy, something our realm had not the capability
      to forge. If our realm held rule of such an amulet, we could ensure the safety
      and suppression of such a being, if the prophesy is to arrive.


      It would
      be wrong to act as though we are not the ones who started this. However, the
      universe will be benefited by us controlling the amulet... this is for the
      greater good

    title: The Amulet
    description: "A device, equipped around the waist, with the power to suppress
      both angelic and demonic power. And what will be the last hope for the final
      realm to wield it as the prophesy is foretold\u2026\r\n\nDemonic and Angelic
      powers hold no moral stance. You can be filled with angelic power, yet angels
      have gone rogue and joined the underworld in their fight."

    title: Three Angels
    description: "The first 3 Angels, forged from the highest powers of the universe,
      with the ability to wield both Angelic and Demonic power.\n\r\nLegend has it
      that the heavens and the underworld once coexisted, but a divide in the beliefs
      of 2 of the First Angels, Erebus and Nyx, led to a war. With the strength of
      the two tearing a rift through the realm as their battle raged on, dividing
      it in two.\n\r\nAs for the 3rd angel, Gaia, they felt the battle of their brother
      and sister would eventually lead to the destruction of not only their realm,
      but the mortal one, in which they had been created to protect. Instead of fighting,
      the 3rd Angel fled to earth, and swore to protect it in case the battle threatened
      the mortal realm.\r"

    title: Eon the Wonderer
    description: "Eon was one of the strongest and smartest Archangels, being one
      of the few survivors of the first war that split the realm. They provided great
      strides in Angel technology, and even developed the bangle used to focus and
      shoot pure Angelic energy.\n\r\n After a while, they grew discontent with their
      status, idealising the strength of the 3 Angels wielded during the first war.
      Wishing for a way to wield such power by controlling Angelic and Demonic energy.
      Reverse-engineered the bangle to draw in demonic energy, which allowed them
      slight control over both elements at once. Though over time, Eon\u2019s mind
      grew mad, and his body was deformed and corrupted by demonic power.\n\r\nIt
      is unclear whether anything of his consciousness remains, as he is driven by
      a brainless desire to consume Angels in a futile attempt to regain Angelic
      power. Now Eon is left with nothing to do but wander the underworld.\r"

    title: Satan the Overseer
    description: "Satan was once a mortal king named Lucifer who lusted to rule all.
      As he grew ill, he made a deal with Erebus just before he went into hiding
      after the first war. Erebus would grant Lucifer all he ever wanted. Immortality,
      A kingdom to reign over, and power beyond what he knew was possible. In return,
      Lucifer would don the name \u201CSatan\u201D and serve as the main protector
      of the underworld.\n\r\nSatan truly believes he rules this realm; however,
      he forgets he is but a pawn in Erebus\u2019s plan. \r"

    title: Felled
    description: "Satan, watching as Eon got corrupted by demonic power, approached
      him. Satan requested to be shown how to reverse engineer a bangle to draw in
      pure demonic energy. Now, many angels captured during wars are turned into
      these mindless zombies that do nothing but chase down Angels in order to feast
      on their energy. Whilst Eon was able to withstand the slow corrosion, due to
      the weaker nature of many angels and this version of the bangle being specifically
      designed to corrupt the user, Angels are quickly corrupted and transformed
      into felled.\r\n\nThere are many cases of many Felled eating their limbs to
      attempt to salvage whatever angelic energy is left of their previous body.\r"

    title: Eyes of Satan
    description: Proto-clones of Satan. Each eye has its own will but can also be
      directly controlled by Satan himself. Whilst the title of Overseer was granted
      due to his standing as the ruler of the underworld, having a bunch of hive-mind
      eyes that feed straight back to him definitely cemented that title.

    title: Screechers
    description: 'The Screechers are an invasive species of sentient plant. They
      utilise a corrosive gas dispersed from spores inside their flower to slowly
      digest their prey or to melt off parts of larger creatures to snack on. Whilst
      they primarily hunt smaller creatures, hives of screechers have been known
      to form a collective to feast on larger creatures.



      They often find
      their way around using the white antenna hidden under their leaves, picking
      up scents and following them to potential prey. The antenna also acts as their
      brain that, when reaching the end of their lifespans, will spontaneously combust
      to spread their seeds.



      Other species of Screechers have been known
      to form dens to lay their offspring, and whilst they tend to have a higher
      output, they are considerably less docile and, in rare cases, have been used
      as food by other species of Screecher.
